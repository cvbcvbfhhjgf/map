# Leaflet Marker Demo

This project is a minimal example of using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with static files.
Markers are loaded from `markers.json` on the main page and a simple admin page lets you manage
markers in `localStorage` and download them as JSON.

## Pages
- `index.html` – shows the map and markers.
- `admin.html` – add or remove markers and export them.

To view the site locally just open the HTML files in a browser or serve the directory with any
static file server.
